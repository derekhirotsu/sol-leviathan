## Game Concepts & Development:
SOL: Leviathan is a prototype of a game that originally aimed to blend the exploration of a Metroidvania with melee and ranged combat that encouraged high-speed bursts of aerial maneuverability. The player would take control of a Leviathan Hunter, an intergalactic hunter-for-hire with a specialty for the eradication of eldritch horrors.

Throughout development, the ability to shift combat styles from air to ground, melee to range, as fluidly as possible was a priority. Offensive options were designed to allow the player to build and maintain their momentum throughout combat scenarios. Early enemy prototypes pressured the player to adapt their playstyle to these differing styles of play, and manage their distance in skillful use of their abilities.

## About this version:

This playable version is an early playtest of the core player abilities, showcasing the the full arsenal of grounded and aerial maneuvers that the player can perform. Players must utilize these abilities to navigate across a set of timed platforming challenges as quickly as possible. This mode is inspired very heavily by the "Break the Targets" minigame from the Super Smash Bros. series as well as drawing thematic inspiration from the VR missions seen in the Metal Gear Solid series.
